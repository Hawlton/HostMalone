# HostMalone
This is my custom Post-Install script for Arch based linux.
Functions:
    Automatically optimizes pacman mirrorlists and runs system updates.
    Installs additional programs from a predefined list.
    Sets custom dns server (adguard by default).
    Configures custom SSH settings (still under construction)
    Configures zshrc file with aliases and neofetch.

This version is old and I will probably create a new script from scratch eventually.
